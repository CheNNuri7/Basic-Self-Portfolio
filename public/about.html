<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Pragna Chennuri. I am an incoming second year majoring in computer science at University
  of California, Santa Cruz.

<p>I am an entry level programmer with experience in coding in Python, html, and CSS. I hope to further
  enhance my skills and use my skills to make positive contributions to society. While I am currently unsure
  about my area of focus in the tech industry I am open to learning new things and working on projects.
